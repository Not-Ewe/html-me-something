                    <p>You're not the first! He doesn't mind. His name was originally "Schr&#246;der" at the Humane Society, but we decided to change that up. When we met for the first time in the private room, "Schr&#246;der" was so excited to meet me (and I, him) that he bolted over to me, threw his front paws on my chest, and immediately "marked" my pant leg as his own. In our excitement, an involuntary gutteral sound came out of me in the form of "YEARF!!", and he immediately sat down and gave me that look that confirmed we were instantly buddies for life.</p>
                    <p>TLDR: It rhymes with "barf".</p>

                    <p>Now Jarph isn't a bad dog, but he does like to find out what various things taste like, and it turns out that he has very expensive tastes. Over the years he has eaten two mattresses, about 10 pairs of shoes, and countless socks and "unmentionables". He even dined on $2500 worth of camera gear in one sitting. This boy has tastes!!</p>

                    <h2>The time he ran away....</h3>
                    <p>One day during a particularly lound rainstorm, Jarph got a bit too scared of the thunder and lightneing that he thought it'd be a good idea to jump out the window and run away for five days. Unfortunately, I was at work at the time (a roommate had opened the window at our house) so Jarphie had a three hour start before I could get on the streets to look for him. Luckily, a strong group of friends (and even total strangers) came out of the woodwork to help me search, make flyers, and generally just chill while my buddy was exploring the town. Five days, later I got a call that he was found by a super nice guy named Mike who opened up his house to him right before the next rainstorm!!</p>
